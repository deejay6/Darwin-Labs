Monitor Snapdeal Api's and tried to make similar to them with some own additions.

I have Used Django Framework.

For DataBase Structure You can refer Snapdeal/myapp/models.py.

For All API's and logics refer Snapdeal/myapp/views.py.

For URL for API's refer Snapdeal/Snapdeal/urls.py.

First Clone the whole Directory and run the server on local (python manage.py runserver).

Then you can test the api url's using 'Postman' or similar tool like it.
